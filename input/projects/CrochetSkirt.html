    <h2>Project: Crochet Skirt</h2>

    <p>This is a maxi-skirt project made from <a href="">recycled blue yarn</a>. This is a bit of a boring one in that I am just copying a free pattern with a fair bit of adjustment but it does make a beautiful skirt.</p>

    <h3>Crocheting the Skirt</h3>
    <p> The pattern is <a></a> and uses [insert pack size - 1] balls of <a></a>. This is handy as you can buy a pack of this yarn in bulk. The pattern is slightly difficult to follow in that I wasn't always sure which section or pattern should follow which, so I really just used it for the pretty stitch and ruffle edge stitch diagrams.</p>

    <p> Since the yarn I had wasn't the same gauge as the patterns suggested yarn (it was much thicker), I just sized the waistband correctly (measuring it on myself) and then carried on with as many of the repeating pattern as would fit in that space. The same for the ruffle between each section (I just fit in as many as I could). When it came to increases I increased by a proportion of the total number of patterns e.g. I fit 17 motifs into the first section of the skirt, the pattern fit [insert]. The pattern suggests an increase to [insert] motifs, so I increased to [insert]/[insert]*17 motifs. This gave the skirt a nice flair.</p>

    <p>I kept going until the skirt reached the length I wanted. I blocked it very basically by leaving it to hang with its own weight on the clothes horse.</p>

    <h3>Additions</h3>
    <p>Since this dress is 90% holes, I'm not sure that I would get much wear out of it in the Welsh weather without a lining. I had some leftover blue satin from my COVID induced sewing experiments and this light blue produced a nice contrast with the dark blue yarn. I made a simple slip skirt, copying the bottom of a dress I already had.</p>
    <p>The last step is to add a zip combining the skirt and the lining together. This is something I will probably have to do by hand to properly anchor it to the yarn.</p>
