    <h2>Project: Recycled Mosaic Mirror</h2>

    <p>When going through charity shops, I always saw a lot a single pretty plates. I thought there's probably not many people out there buying one nice plate on its own but the collector ones are often the nicest. To that end, I descided to smash some up and put them on a mirror.</p>
    <p>The first step was adding a frame of OSB to our old bedroom mirror. My bofriend kindly offered to make this but in a foul twist of fate he accidentally knicked the corner of the glass while drilling and it shattered. Oh dear. So instead I found a nice one on Facebook marketplace (still secondhand) which didn't need the frame and I set to work...</p>
    <h3>Materials</h3>
    <p>The following things are needed to complete a project similar to this. I suspect you could use a powdered grout but I got the adhesive premade kind to make sure the tiles really stuck on there.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>5 old plates (with pretty designs)</li>
        <li>Mirror (or other object to mosaic)</li>
        <li>Tile Nippers</li>
        <li>Painters Masking Tape</li>
        <li>Grout - a pot of premixed (wet) adhesive and grout combo</li>
        <li>Hammer (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparing</h3>
    <p>The first step was to prepare the tiles. First I picked different green plates from different charity shops and tried to pick 5 with all different kinds of designs on. One was a green willow pattern, some bird and plant collectors plates, a plain sage Ikea one and a glassy one with a green backing. Smashing the plates on the garage floor was extremely satifying. I just threw them on the floor (as did my friends and boyfriend) and then used the hammer to break them into smaller pieces. I then nipped them into small squares, removed any of uneven thickness and they were ready to use.</p>

    <p>I then taped the mirror carefully so as to maintain the shape and keep it clean.</p>

    <h3>Mosaic</h3>
    <p>Day 1: I applied a thick coat of grout to the mirror including both sides. Then I placed tiles to cove the whole frame area and the edges. I tried to keep the tiles mostly clean (but found out this doesn't really matter later).I let it dry overnight</p>                                                                                                                                 
    <p>Day 2: The next step was to over-grout this to fill in the gaps between the tiles. I put a large dollop of grout over the tiles and pushed it over (making sure to really apply some pressure in the gaps). I added a large amount of grout to the edge closest to the mirror to make a taper into the mirror. Then I wiped the majority of the grout of each tile to make it easier to clean after. Left it to dry again.</p>
    <p>Day 3: Not quite dry yet. </p>
    <p>Day 4: Final dry! I wiped each tile of painstakingly with a wet cloth and a BP loyalty card and it was done.</p>

    <h3>Final Form</h3>
    <p>This is the finished article from a few angles. He's as bit lumpy but very loveable. I really like the idea of looking at my reflection surrounded by shards of broken collectors plates which used to be so precious. </p>
    <p> If this were in an art gallery here would be my little plaque: This is a commentary on the fleeting nature of life, everything that was once treasured soon will be smashed up and put on my mirror and all that. Or is it a reflection on generational differences, in the past an ornate collectors plate bought with money was treasured but now a mirror I made with my spare time is one of my most precious things. Or did I just want to smash plates in the garage without being wasteful.</p>
