    <h2>Project: Glass Lampshades </h2>
    <p>Following a dream I had where I was sleeping in a forest, I became possessed with a manic fever to turn my bedroom into a green paradise. I didn't want to just buy more stuff so instead I wanted to improve the stuff I already had. This was the motivation for the <a href="kittyfarren.dev/projects/CrochetLampshade.html">Crochet Lampshade</a> where I added crocheted plants and the <a href="kittyfarren.dev/projects/MosaicMirror.html">Mosiac Mirror</a> both of which where also in the green theme.</p>
    <p>I saw a couple videos of people making their own stain glass projects and I thought it looked really cool. Also it would feel good to use the soldering skills I do everyday at work for practical reasons on something pretty. In the recycling/ upcycling theme I decided to use old green glass bottles and the existing lampshade fixings to make a pair of lampshades. The hope is that when the light shines through the lamp, different coloured green leaves will be projected onto the ceiling.</p>

    <h3>Materials</h3>
    <p>The following things are needed to complete a project similar to this. I should warn that I got multiple cuts on my hands despite the cut-proof gloves during the leaf making stage so undertake at your own risk.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Old lampshade fixtures</li>
        <li>12 bottles of variable green colour</li>
        <li>Tile Nipper</li>
        <li>Tile Cutter</li>
        <li>Soldering Iron 60W</li>
        <li>Solder</li>
        <li>Wire</li>
        <li>Copper Tape</li>
        <li>Hammer (Optional)</li>
    </ul>    

    <h3>Preparing Leaves</h3>
    <p>Step 1: Soak the bottles in hot water and washing up liquid to remove the labels. I used an old membership card to scrape them off easily.</p>
    <p>Step 2: Roughly smash the bottle with a hammer or on the ground</p>
    <p>Step 3: Use the glass cutter to score little leaves out of the bottles. These where 5-10cm in length. I used the tile nippers to snap the scored glass more easily. This was the stage where my hands got a bit cut so approach with caution.</p>
    <p>Step 4: Line the pieces in copper tape</p>

    <h3>Making the Shades</h3>
    <p>I wrapped the upper circle of the lampshade fixture in the wire to allow for soldering directly onto. I then attached the leaves one by one to try and build up a canopy kind of shape. I wanted a dense covering near the top and fewer leaves towards the bottom.</p>
    <p>I then cleaned off all the flux marks from the glass and added the shades back onto the lamp.</p>
